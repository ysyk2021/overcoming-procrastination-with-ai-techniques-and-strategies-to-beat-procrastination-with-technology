One way to overcome distractions with AI is through notification systems that prioritize important notifications and filter out irrelevant ones. For example, an AI-powered email client can learn which emails are most important to us and notify us accordingly, while filtering out less important emails. This allows us to stay focused on our work without constantly being distracted by irrelevant notifications.

AI-powered notification systems can also be used for other types of distractions, such as social media or messaging apps. These tools use machine learning algorithms to analyze our behavior and identify patterns of distraction. Based on this analysis, the tool can block distracting notifications during times when we need to stay focused.
